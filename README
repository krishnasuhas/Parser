This Project is  all about converting one language to onother language.

which includes many stages like:-

1)	Syntax check.
2)	Semantic check.
3)	Scope Check.
4)	Converting/ Generating C Code.
5) 	Adding Functionalities.

Some of the result's of	this project are Shown Below.

e program1:-

@a,i
@s
a = 25
s = 11
!s
" i = a ; i & 10 ;i=i-1`
!s
?


generated code:

void main()
{


	int x_a, x_i;
	
	int x_s;
	x_a =  25;
	x_s =  11;
	printf( "%d\n", x_s );
	for( x_i =x_a;x_i> 10;x_i=x_i- 1)
{
		printf( "%d\n", x_s );
	}
return;
}


output of c code:

e program2

@a,i
@s
a = 25
s = 11
!s
" i = a ; i $ 10 ;i=i-1`
!s
?

generated code:

void main()
{


	int x_a, x_i;
	
	int x_s;
	x_a =  25;
	x_s =  11;
	printf( "%d\n", x_s );
	for( x_i =x_a;x_i< 10;x_i=x_i- 1)
{
		printf( "%d\n", x_s );
	}
return;
}


output of c code:

11


conclusion:-
result code is working well even with new functionality on For Loops.
